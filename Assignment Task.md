# Assignment Prompt: Retail Store

#### Location Scraper
As a data scientist, it's important to know how to scrape data from various sources,
including websites. For this assignment, your task is to scrape the locations of your
favourite retail brand in India and extract the following information:
- Store Name
- Address
- Timings
- Coordinates (Latitude/Longitude) (bonus)
- Phone Number

You can use any programming language of your choice, but we recommend using
Python. Once you have extracted the data, you will need to store it in a CSV file and
upload it to a GitHub repository alongside with the code.

Here are the steps to follow:
1. Identify your favourite retail brand with stores in India. Pick something that you enjoy buying things from.
2. Use web scraping techniques to extract the store locations, store name, address, timings, coordinates, and phone number from the website. It’s usually tricky to get the coordinates so it’s a fun challenge to see if you can do it.
3. Store the extracted data in a CSV file.
4. Upload the CSV file and an executable Python script to a GitHub repository.
5. Write a brief report documenting your approach, including any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

We encourage you to be creative with your approach and showcase your data science
skills. Good luck, and have fun!
